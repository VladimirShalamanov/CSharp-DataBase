> # Entity Framework Core
> The course follows in detail the work with the ORM technology: Entity Framework Core (EF core), which is a standard for ORM in C# and .NET Core applications. EF Core enables mapping between a relational database and an object-oriented model through "database first" and "code first" approaches, and provides a powerful object-oriented API for querying the database and performing CRUD operations. EF core provides both an additional level of abstraction and an easy way to process the data from the database.
>
> The course will demonstrate established practices in building the database layer of complex systems in C# applications through built-in implementations of the Repository pattern and the use of the service layer (Service Layer), as well as
> * import and export to different data formats (JSON, XML).

> Databases are the standard way of using dynamic information in modern technology, making them an indispensable part of almost every application. The intensive course on the basics of databases will introduce students to one of the most widely used database management systems (DBMS) used in the development of modern information systems - Microsoft SQL Server.

> Provides fundamental knowledge of working with ACID transactions and transaction processing and practical tips for performance tuning. This course lays the foundations of working with databases, making it easier to use them in real-world applications and to understand concepts such as converting a database into an object-oriented model (ORM).
